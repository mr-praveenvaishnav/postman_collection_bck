		"description": "Welcome to Shiprocket's API Documentation. We've designed this document to help developers and Shiprocket users fully understand and integrate our API for a seamless and easy deployment. These APIs enable you to utilize most of your Shiprocket account's panel features fully.\n\nWe've listed all the APIs, their required parameters, and their example requests and responses on the right for easy understanding. The easiest way to start using the Shiprocket APIs is by clicking the **Run in Postman** button above. The [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a free tool that helps developers run and debug API requests.\n\nOur APIs are based around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) architecture and use the basic [HTTP](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_status_codes) request methods. Our APIs accept [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) - encoded body requests and return data in the same form.\n\nPlease note that you will need to [upgrade](https://app.shiprocket.in/billing-plan-details) your Shiprocket plan to Advance or Pro to use all the APIs. Read through the following sections for the integration process.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nFirst, you need to register with ShipRocket and create an account. Click on this [link](https://app.shiprocket.in/register) to complete the sign-up process.\n\nAfter the sign-up process is complete, follow the enlisted steps to create an API user:\n\n1.  Open your Shiprocket account and navigate to the left-hand panel.\n2.  Click On **Settings => API => Configure => Create an API user**.\n3.  On the pop-up menu, fill in the **email** (this should be different from the one used to register to ShipRocket).\n4.  Fill in an appropriate password and confirm the password.\n5.  Click on **'Generate API Credential'**. On successful completion, you should have a new API user-generated.\n6.  The next step will be to use the *Authentication API* to obtain an authentication token. Copy this token and use it to authenticate your further API calls.\n    \n\n# Document and API Usage Guidelines\n\n*   Our APIs use the basic HTTP request codes: *POST*, *GET*, *PATCH*, & *PUT*.\n*   You can select the required response and request code language by selecting it from the drop-down menu on the top.\n*   You can import and test all our full API collection in the Postman app by clicking on the **' Run in Postman'** button.\n*   **Note**: Any requests made using the valid API credentials will affect the real-time data in your Shiprocket account.\n*   Authorization: Bearer\n    \n\n*   All the APIs are provided with their appropriate example requests and responses for successful and failed calls. The example definitions are:\n    *   **Successful Call**: The API call was correct.\n    *   **Invalid Data**: The data entered was incorrect.\n    *   **Missing Fields**: Some of the required fields are missing.\n    *   **Wrong Format**: There is a syntax error in the code.\n*   **Note**: The `order_id` defined by you at the time of order creation is your reference order id. The `order_id` returned in the API response is the *Shiprocket order id*. All our APIs will use this Shiprocket order id to access your created order unless stated otherwise.\n    \n\n# Errors and Response codes\n\nWhile using Shiprocket's APIs, you may run into some standard response and error codes. The most common ones are listed along with their descriptions as follows:\n\n| **RESPONSE CODE** | **DESCRIPTION** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `200` & `202` - **OK** & **Accepted** | Everything worked as expected, and you'll get a response. Some APIs may respond with an error message if data is invalid. |\n| `400` - **Bad Request** | The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. |\n| `401` - **Unauthorized** | There is some error during validation. You need to check your token or credentials. |\n| `404` - **Not Found** | The URI requested is invalid or the resource requested does not exist. |\n| `405` - **Method Not Allowed** | The API was accessed using the wrong method. Check your HTTP method. |\n| `422` - **Unprocessable Entity** | It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled. Try checking your code for errors. |\n| `429` - **Too Many Requests** | You have exceeded the API call rate limit. |\n| `500`, `502`, `503`, `504` - **Server Errors** | Some server error has occurred. Some APIs may show this due to syntax or parameter errors. Try contacting support if this persists. |\n\n# Webhooks\n\nYou can set up a webhook with Shiprocket to get tracking updates. We will proactively notify your system whenever there is a new tracking event for an order.\n\n**Setup**:\n\n*   Log in to your Shiprocket account\n*   Go to Settings > API > Webhooks\n*   Add the webhook URL\n*   Enable the toggle\n*   Add the security token (not mandatory)\n    \n\nWhen we get a new tracking event, a POST request is made to the callback URL you added to your Shiprocket account.\n\n**Webhook Specifications:**\n\n*   Method: POST\n*   The `Content-Type` header should be set to `application/json`\n*   Please refrain from using keywords like shiprocket, kartrocket, sr, or kr in your webhook URL\n*   Security token should be an`x-api-key`\n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n### Sample Body:\n\n``` json\n{\n\"awb\": 59629792084,\n\"current_status\": \"Delivered\",\n\"order_id\": \"13905312\",\n\"current_timestamp\": \"2021-07-02 16:41:59\",\n\"etd\": \"2021-07-02 16:41:59\",\n\"current_status_id\": 7,\n\"shipment_status\": \"Delivered\",\n\"shipment_status_id\": 7,\n\"channel_order_id\": \"enter your channel order id\",\n\"channel\": \"enter your channel name\",\n\"courier_name\": \"enter courier_name\",\n\"scans\": [\n{\n\"date\": \"2019-06-25 12:08:00\",\n\"activity\": \"SHIPMENT DELIVERED\",\n\"location\": \"PATIALA\"\n},\n{\n\"date\": \"2019-06-25 12:06:00\",\n\"activity\": \"NECESSARY CHARGES PENDING FROM CONSIGNEE\",\n\"location\": \"PATIALA\"\n},\n{\n\"date\": \"2019-06-25 10:18:00\",\n\"activity\": \"SHIPMENT OUT FOR DELIVERY\",\n\"location\": \"PATIALA\"\n},\n{\n\"date\": \"2019-06-25 09:40:00\",\n\"activity\": \"SHIPMENT ARRIVED\",\n\"location\": \"PATIALA\"\n},\n{\n\"date\": \"2019-06-25 07:32:00\",\n\"activity\": \"SHIPMENT FURTHER CONNECTED\",\n\"location\": \"AMBALA AIR HUB\"\n},\n{\n\"date\": \"2019-06-25 07:03:00\",\n\"activity\": \"SHIPMENT ARRIVED AT HUB\",\n\"location\": \"AMBALA AIR HUB\"\n},\n{\n\"date\": \"2019-06-25 00:45:00\",\n\"activity\": \"SHIPMENT FURTHER CONNECTED\",\n\"location\": \"KAPASHERA HUB\"\n},\n{\n\"date\": \"2019-06-25 00:20:00\",\n\"activity\": \"SHIPMENT ARRIVED AT HUB\",\n\"location\": \"KAPASHERA HUB\"\n},\n{\n\"date\": \"2019-06-24 23:17:00\",\n\"activity\": \"SHIPMENT FURTHER CONNECTED\",\n\"location\": \"COD PROCESSING CENTRE I\"\n},\n{\n\"date\": \"2019-06-24 21:14:00\",\n\"activity\": \"SHIPMENT ARRIVED\",\n\"location\": \"COD PROCESSING CENTRE I\"\n},\n{\n\"date\": \"2019-06-24 18:56:00\",\n\"activity\": \"SHIPMENT PICKED UP\",\n\"location\": \"COD PROCESSING CENTRE I\"\n}\n]\n}\n\n```\n\n### Support:\n\n*   All the required information on integration is in this document.

						"description": "Use this API to create a quick custom order. Quick orders are the ones where we do not store the product details in the master catalogue. \n\nYou have to pass all the required params at the minimum to create a quick custom order. You can add additional parameters as per your preference.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- In case the 'shipping_is_billing' field is false, further shipping detail fields are required.\n\nIf no channel id is passed, the order will be assigned to the default custom channel. If the channel id is not known, use the 'Get All Channels' API to get the list of all integrated channels in your Shiprocket account.\n\n- order_id field cannot be equal to an already existing id. Doing so does not change or affect the existing order.\n\n- New orders cannot be created with order id's same as that of cancelled orders. If error 422 shows up despite filling in the correct details, consider changing the order_id.\n\n- Be sure to input the correct calculated sub_total amount. The total is not calculated automatically through the API.\n\n- The 'order_id' returned in the response is the Shiprocket order_idPlease save this order ID as we will use this in future API calls.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n\n|       **PARAMS**       \t|   **REQUIRED**  \t|  **DATA TYPE** \t|                                                                          **DESCRIPTION**                                                                         \t|        **EXAMPLE**       \t|\n|:----------------------:\t|:---------------:\t|:--------------:\t|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:\t|:------------------------:\t|\n|        `order_id`       \t|       YES       \t|    *string*    \t|              The order id you want to specify to the order.
